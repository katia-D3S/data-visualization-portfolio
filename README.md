# data-visualization-portfolio
📊 A portfolio of my analytics dashboards and data visualizations created in Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio, and Excel.

Before building each visualization, all datasets were cleaned, standardized, explored, and transformed.
This included feature extraction, forecasting future prices, solving small optimization problems (e.g., best combination of series), or/and identifying undervalued or overvalued items using analytical rules.

i) Power BI -  Price Dynamics & Forecasting Dashboard

Interactive dashboard showing historical and forecasted price trends by region, project type, year, and other dimensions.
